Please download a cartoon-style TTF/WOFF font (e.g., Baloo 2 from Google Fonts) and place the font file here as Baloo2-Regular.ttf.

Steps:
1. Download Baloo 2 (or preferred free cartoon font) TTF from Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+2
2. Save the file as:
   assets/fonts/Baloo2-Regular.ttf
3. Reload the game page; the app uses @font-face to load the local font.

If you want me to fetch and add a specific open-license font here, grant permission to download from a URL.
